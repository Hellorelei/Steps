# Steps

Steps is a game about the earth. And because most of the earth is covered in water, it's mostly about water!

## The game

Out murder-glorifying tower defenses, this is about defending something better. Something more important, something closer. Water! A water defense, if you will. And not a water tower, which is something else.

And so, **you**, our most valued employee, have just gotten a promotion. From standing on the parking lot to being in charge of the very health and safety of Los City. You must ensure that **sewer water** goes from murky hazard to pure, safe, **clean water**.
